## Export to NWB

You can export the results of the VAME workflow to the [Neurodata Without Borders](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/) (NWB) format, which is a standard format for storing and sharing data in the neuroscience community. VAME uses the [ndx-pose](https://github.com/rly/ndx-pose) and [ndx-vame](https://github.com/catalystneuro/ndx-vame) NWB extensions to store the pose estimation data and the VAME pipeline results, respectively. Each session in the project will be exported to a separate NWB file.

To export the results, first load the project configuration data and then call the `export_to_nwb` function:

```python
from vame.io import export_to_nwb
import vame

config = vame.read_config("path_to/project/config.yaml")
export_to_nwb(config=config)
```
