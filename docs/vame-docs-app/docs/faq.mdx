### Frequently Asked Questions
<details>
  <summary>What is VAME?</summary>
  <p>
    VAME is a framework to cluster behavioral signals obtained from pose-estimation tools. 
    It is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based deep learning framework which leverages the power 
    of recurrent neural networks (RNN) to model sequential data. 
    In order to learn the underlying complex data distribution, we use the RNN in a variational autoencoder 
    setting to extract the latent state of the animal in every step of the input time series.

  <summary>[Advanced][Community Analysis] Why is the default value of 'cut_tree' set to 3?</summary>
  <p>
    Starting in VAME 0.12, we have added a default that the communities are assigned by cutting the dendrogram at node level 3. In a purely bifurcating dendrogram, this would result in 8 communities (A-H).<br>
    See [image] example of a dendrogram before and after node-3 cut.<br>
    This approach is recommended for VAME analysis of murine exploration of an open field for >20 minutes. Other species or behavioral conditions may result in dendrogram that are differently structured than the above     example. In those cases, users may consider selectin a higher or lower cut level (passed as an argument), or making custom motif->community assignments (post-VAME, done manually).
