# VAME Project Brief

## Overview
VAME (Variational Animal Motion Encoding) is an open-source machine learning tool designed for behavioral action segmentation and analyses. It leverages deep learning techniques to identify and analyze behavioral patterns in animal motion data.

## Core Requirements and Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Provide scalable, unbiased, and sensitive approaches for assessing mouse behavior
2. Enable automated segmentation of behavioral signals from pose-estimation tools
3. Support behavioral neuroscience research with robust analytical capabilities

### Technical Requirements
1. Process pose estimation data from multiple sources (DeepLabCut, SLEAP, LightningPose)
2. Implement efficient variational autoencoder with RNN architecture
3. Support GPU acceleration for model training
4. Provide comprehensive visualization tools for analysis

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Processing and analysis of pose estimation data
- Behavioral signal clustering and segmentation
- Community analysis of behavioral patterns
- Integration with common pose estimation tools
- Visualization and reporting capabilities

### Out of Scope
- Raw video processing (relies on pose estimation tools)
- Real-time analysis (focuses on post-processing)
- Direct pose estimation (integrates with existing tools)

## Key Stakeholders

### Development Team
- Original VAME developers: Kevin Luxem and Pavol Bauer
- Behavioral neuroscientists: Stephanie R. Miller and Jorge J. Palop
- Computer scientists and statisticians: Alex Pico, Reuben Thomas, and Katie Ly
